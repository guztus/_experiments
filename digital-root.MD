The digital root of 0 is 0
The digital root of 12 is 3 (1 + 3)
The digital root of 85 is 4 (8 + 5 = 13 -> 1 + 3 = 4)

convert number to array to get the individual numbers  (8, 5) (9, 9, 9, 9)
Sum the numbers (13) (38)

IF its over 10 sum the digits again (1 + 3 = 4)  (3 + 8 = 11)
IF its over 10 sum the digits again             (1 + 1 = 2)
